<br />

<br />
I was happily using a very old version of Keyman (3.2 I think) with my own homemade &quot;european&quot; Keyboard on my Win 98 SE system until the beginning of February when a sudden glitch with some files on my hard drive meant that Windows stopped working properly and I had to re-install it.
<br />

<br />
Since re-installing Windows 98, and updating my browser to Firefox 1.5, I found that Keyman 3.2 wasn&#039;t working properly any more.  Specifically, it was failing to load at Windows startup, and when manually loaded, if I typed the key combination <span style="font-weight: bold">a&quot;</span> in Firefox, which in my keyboard should have produced <span style="font-weight: bold">채</span>, it actually produced <span style="font-weight: bold">a채</span>.  These errors persisted despite me re-installing Keyman 3.2.
<br />

<br />
After much fiddling without effect, I decided to try updating to the new version of Keyman, and try converting my &quot;european&quot; Keyboard to a version 6 compatible Keyboard file.
<br />

<br />
I have managed this, and the new Keyboard works fine in applications such as Word 97 on my system.
<br />

<br />
However, there is absolutely no response from Keyman when typing in Firefox on a website such as Google Mail, or indeed this very forum - or even when typing in the address bar.  It is as if Keyman were not even present, but it definitely is present and switched on with the correct keyboard loaded.
<br />

<br />
Have I missed something, or is this a known incompatibility?  Any suggestions on how I can make things work like they used to up until the beginning of last month?
<br />

<br />
Thanks

Hi Martin,
<br />

<br />
I have not tested Firefox 1.5 on Windows 98 - so am unable to give a definitive answer - but quickly - are you using a Unicode keyboard or a legacy codepage based keyboard?
<br />

<br />
I will try and have a look at Firefox 1.5 on Windows 98 when I have some spare time.
<br />

<br />
Kind Regards,
<br />

It&#039;s Keyman 3.2 and I wrote the .kmn file using a simple text editor and it runs in Keyman.  None of this complicated modern compiling and suchlike!  When I upgraded to Keyman 6 I modified the file so that it would compile, and tried it both using Unicode and the other option (can&#039;t remember what that was called now).
<br />

<br />
As I mentioned, the problem with Keyman 3.2 seems to have coincided with both my upgrading to Firefox 1.5 (under Windows 98SE by the way, not 98) and also the crash I had at the start of February.  So a number of (unknown) files were lost and it&#039;s hard to know if Keyman depends on any of them being correctly loaded.  I have now got Windows back to the state where everything else works...
<br />

<br />
So you may find that it works fine with you and the problem is not incompatibility but my dodgy old computer.
<br />

<br />
Grateful for any light you can shed.

If you are running the Standard Edition of Keyman, could you create a Diagnostic Report and send it through to Tavultesoft, so we can find out what might be interfering with Firefox and Keyman?
<br />

<br />
Does Keyman work properly with other applications on your system?  Do you have any plugins or extensions installed in Firefox?

Keyman works fine with other applications, not just Internet Explorer, but also Microsoft Word and Open Office. 
<br />

<br />
I have a few FireFox Plugins: DownThemAll!, Adblock, Tab X and HTML Validator. 
<br />

<br />
It just occured to me that I&#039;m using version 6.0.140.0 of Keyman, so I&#039;ll install the latest version and let you know when the problem persists. 
<br />

<br />
I can&#039;t see any other obvious issues in the report.  Some other questions:
<br />

<br />
<ul>Are you using a Unicode or ANSI keyboard - which keyboard?
<br />
When you try using Keyman in Firefox, does it just come out with German letters, or do you get no response at all?
<br />
Does the Keyman keyboard work in the address bar or search box?
<br />
Does the Keyman keyboard work when you select File-&amp;gt;Open File?</ul>

I have now managed to reproduce this issue here in my office - the issue is with Ctrl and Alt modifiers.  I have logged an issue document in our system and we will find a resolution for this, hopefully in the next patch release.
